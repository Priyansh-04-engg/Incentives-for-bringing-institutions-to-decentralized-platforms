This smart contract is designed to incentivize institutions for participating in decentralized platforms, specifically by rewarding them for verifying transactions, reducing intermediaries, and engaging in decentralized activities. The contract operates on the Ethereum blockchain or any EVM-compatible network.

## Features

- **Incentive Pool**: Institutions earn rewards for actions such as verifying transactions.
- **Transparency & Auditing**: Actions taken by institutions are logged on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record.
- **Institution Verification**: Institutions must be registered and verified before they can interact with the system and receive rewards.
- **Reward System**: Institutions are rewarded for verifying transactions or for participation in other decentralized activities.
- **Incentive Pool Management**: The contract owner can refill the incentive pool to ensure continuous rewards.
